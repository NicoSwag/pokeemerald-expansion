OK HERE'S THE FUN STUFF NOW

Welcome to the technically the second demo for Cataclysm Emerald, although the previous one was absolutely nothing like this. 
No, this is actually a proper taste of what the full game will look like. It's been a long journey, and it's nowhere near done, 
although now that all the proper frameworks and mechanics are in place, development should hopefully speed up a bit.
I've had  lot of fun creating my ideal version of this game, and I hope you will have fun too playing it. Please note that
a lot of the changes are extremely experimental, and very different from what you're probably used to seeing from Rom Hacks.
Do also note that this game is NOT MEANT TO BE NUZLOCKED so if you try and it's too hard, well, play normally.
Anyway, without further ado, here's the list of all features.

FEATURING:
- A new and reimagined Hoenn. Old areas are completely different, and a large number of new ones to discover have been added,
all with their unique vibe and climate. Exploration is more than encouraged: everyone has something new to
say, and mysterious shards hidden in every area can be exchanged to learn powerful moves.

- A completely new story. What starts out as a small scale adventure quickly turns into a big conspiracy, as Team Magma,
Team Aqua and Devon Corporation race to uncover the secrets of an ancient civilization, whose power could change the
world. This is a brand new world, and what you remember from the original setting may be turned upside down.

- A new difficulty system. Inspired by RPGs such as Shin Megami Tensei and Dark Souls, the new system aims to provide a
challenge while still allowing players to go through the game without needing to resort on self-imposed restrictions.
Saving is now only possible at certain spots, and losing means a trip back to the title screen. With limited healing,
scarce resources and trainer rematches, you will need to think about your strategy in order to succeed.
Speaking of…

- Comprehensive rebalancing of everything. Not only a myriad of new moves, abilities and mechanics have been added (and even Pokémon!), but
many existing ones got reworked in order to fit into a vision of the game able to produce exciting moments, work alongside the story and
result in a more pleasant experience. Of course, you will also need to relearn many things about the basics, but don't worry! Many NPCs will
put you back up to speed with what's changed. Try visiting the Rustboro Trainer's School for a crash course!

SPECIFIC CHANGES

- Every Trainer fight is  double battle.

- Changes to pretty much every Pokémon. You will be able to check them in the Pokédex directly (although it is still a bit broken right now).
Everyone is viable, everyone has something to bring to the table.

- Breeding is removed. Egg Moves are learned at a Special Move Tutor located in every Pokémon Center in exchange for Sky Fragments. More
moves unlock as a Pokémon evolves.

- Healing items are no longer able to be purchased or obtained on the field. Instead you will receive a set amount at Pokémon Centers, depending on
how many badges you have. It works similarly to Dark Souls, so you have a maximum that gets "refilled": In addition, some NPCs will gift you items that
allow you to receive berries, as well.

- Caught Pokémon can immediately be added to the party. However, you can't actually access the PC on the field, but you can only send mons there when
you catch an extra one.

- TMs are single use, but once you find one it will be infinitely sold in shops.

- Trainers in a route will keep refighting you until you defeat an "area boss". This can be either a normal trainer or a story encounter, depending on
the section. Trainers reward money only once.

- Saving can only be done at save points.

- Losing any fight results in going back to the title screen.

- Running from a Pokémon is three times harder.

- The economy is completely overhauled. Wild Pokémon drop a small amount of money, as well.

- There is a soft level cap in place (although overleveling is possible and not discouraged to an extent), as well as a catch-up mechanic for lower
leveled Pokémon.

- Very light level scaling exists, but only for enemy trainers that have fallen way behind of the curve.

- Affection and friendships do not exist (rip the power of love)

. Gender is way more irrelevant, and only really affects gender-specific evolutions.

- Freeze is changed to Frostbite (from Legends Arceus)

- Frostbite and Burn to 1/12 damage, a midpoint between the old values of 1/8 and 1/16 (not sure if this is necessary but whatever)

- Sleeping is completely changed. It still lasts between 1 and 3 turns, but sleeping Pokémon heal 1/8 of their HP every turn. In
addition, hitting a sleeping Pokémon with a damaging attack wakes it up. Rest (and other eventual self-sleeping moves) still use 
the old mechanics, however.

- Paralysis is completely changed. Now it no longer stops Pokémon from acting, and it doesn't decrease speed: instead, it lowers the priority
of all moves by one. It also decreases evasion by 30%.

- Hail is changed to Snow (from Legends Arceus)

- New weather: Pollution. Pollution damages Pokémon by 1/16 of their HP unless they're poison, ghost, or dark type. It also weakens fairy moves by 50%.
Moves that double in power if the opponent is poisoned will always do so, even if the opponent isn't poisoned. Some moves and abilities interact with
pollution.


- Weather and Terrain-inducing effects work completely differently now.

- Abilities that summon Weather or Terrain specifically on switch-in (such as Drought or Electric Surge, but not Seed Sower) now summon that 
weather permanently, as long as the user is on the field. If it leaves the field for any reason, the weather ends. It also can be changed by other effects. 

- Abilities and moves that summon Weather or Terrain at will or under other conditions summon it for five turns, as normal. However, if the user
is holding an extending item (weather rocks or terrain extender), the weather or terrain will last indefinitely until it gets changed.

- If a weather ends or terrain ends, the field will go back to the same weather or terrain that the battle started with (if it's raining, it will
rain again, for example).

- Several types have had their type matchups and properties changed. See the type chart for an overall look, but changes will still be reported here.

- Bug types hit fairy for neutral damage and resist dark and fairy. They are also unaffected by confusion.

- Fighting types are immune to ghost. They're also immune to taunt, encore and torment.

- Rock types are neutral to ground and resist rock.

- Ice types now resist water and flying.

- Fairy types resist dragon, instead of being immune to it.

- Psychic types are unaffected by flinching.

- Normal types cannot be affected by primary statues through secondary effects. For instance: thunderbolt will never paralyze, but thunder wave will.
