- Every Trainer fight is  double battle.

- Changes to pretty much every Pokémon. You will be able to check them in the Pokédex directly (although it is still a bit broken right       now). Everyone gets cool new things!

- Breeding is removed. Egg Moves are learned at a Special Move Tutor located in every Pokémon Center in exchange for Sky Fragments. More
  moves unlock as a Pokémon evolves.

- Healing items are no longer able to be purchased or obtained on the field. Instead you will receive a set amount at Pokémon Centers,       depending on how many badges you have. It works similarly to Dark Souls, so you have a maximum that gets "refilled": In addition, some     NPCs will gift you items that allow you to receive berries, as well.

- TMs are single use, but once you find one it will be infinitely sold in shops.

- Trainers in a route will keep refighting you until you defeat an "area boss". This can be either a normal trainer or a story encounter,   depending on the section. Trainers reward money only once.

- Saving can only be done at save points.

- Losing any fight results in going back to the title screen.

- Running from a Pokémon is three times harder.

- The economy is completely overhauled. Wild Pokémon drop a small amount of money, as well.

- There is a soft level cap in place (although overleveling is possible and not discouraged to an extent), as well as a catch-up mechanic   for lower leveled Pokémon.

- Very light level scaling exists, but only for enemy trainers that have fallen way behind of the curve.

- Affection and friendships do not exist (rip the power of love)

. Gender is way more irrelevant, and only really affects gender-specific evolutions.

- Freeze is changed to Frostbite (from Legends Arceus)

- Frostbite and Burn to 1/12 damage, a midpoint between the old values of 1/8 and 1/16 (not sure if this is necessary but whatever)

- Sleeping is completely changed. It still lasts between 1 and 3 turns, but sleeping Pokémon heal 1/8 of their HP every turn. In
  addition, hitting a sleeping Pokémon with a damaging attack wakes it up. Rest (and other eventual self-sleeping moves) still use 
  the old mechanics, however.

- Paralysis is completely changed. Now it no longer stops Pokémon from acting, and it doesn't decrease speed: instead, it lowers the     priority of all moves by one. It also decreases evasion by 30%.

- Hail is changed to Snow (from Legends Arceus)

- New weather: Pollution. Pollution damages Pokémon by 1/16 of their HP unless they're poison, ghost, or dark type. It also weakens fairy   moves by 50%. Moves that double in power if the opponent is poisoned will always do so, even if the opponent isn't poisoned. Some moves and abilities interact with pollution.


- Weather and Terrain-inducing effects work completely differently now.

- Abilities that summon Weather or Terrain specifically on switch-in (such as Drought or Electric Surge, but not Seed Sower) now summon   that weather permanently, as long as the user is on the field. If it leaves the field for any reason, the weather ends. It also can be   changed by other effects. 

- Abilities and moves that summon Weather or Terrain at will or under other conditions summon it for five turns, as normal. However, if   the user is holding an extending item (weather rocks or terrain extender), the weather or terrain will last indefinitely until it gets   changed.

- If a weather ends or terrain ends, the field will go back to the same weather or terrain that the battle started with (if it's raining,    it will rain again, for example).

- Bug types hit fairy for neutral damage and resist dark and fairy. They are also unaffected by confusion.

- Fighting types are immune to ghost. They're also immune to taunt, encore and torment.

- Rock types are neutral to ground and resist rock.

- Ice types now resist water and flying.

- Fairy types resist dragon, instead of being immune to it.

- Psychic types are unaffected by flinching.

- Normal types cannot be affected by primary statues through secondary effects. For instance: Thunderbolt will never paralyze, but Thunder   Wave will.
